## Acknowledgments

I would really thank you [KEVIN POWELL](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob), for his wonderfull suggestion on giving a shot to Frontend Mentor. I think it worked for me. As, being a Backend Developer I wanted to go for Full-Stack so, I really need a strong hold on Advanced CSS. Frontend Mentor is really good to have a realtime practice session on-the-go.
